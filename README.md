### Aspiring C# Developer

Hi! I'm a C# developer. Most of my experience comes from the Unity engine, as well as working with the latest versions of .NET.

I've been learning to program for several years, and I'm now in college working towards a degree in Computer Science or Software Engineering. Pretty exciting stuff!
